# GeoServer REST API v1.0 OpenAPI 3 definition files

This folder contains the OpenAPI 3 definition files for GeoServer's REST API v1.
Differently from the legacy Swagger 2 definitions, this one focuses only in inter-process communication
using JSON for request/response encoding.

This API is developed using the Swagger 2 files as base, but carefully inspecting GeoServer's REST config server
implementation, often debugging it, in order to comply with the actual API as much as possible.
