YSLD Styling
============

This module adds support for the YSLD styling language.

:geotools:`YSLD <extension/ysld.html>` is a YAML based language which closely matches the structure of SLD, and the internal data model that GeoServer's renderer uses.  For details on YSLD syntax see the reference below or the GeoTools documentation.

YSLD is not a part of GeoServer by default, but is available as an optional install.
