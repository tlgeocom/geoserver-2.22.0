OpenSearch/STAC JSON templates
==============================

General rules for writing the (Geo)JSON templates:

* Single ``//`` and multiline ``/* ... */`` comments are allowed in the input, for the editor's convenience.
  and will be discarded in the output.
* The properties follow the same names as the OpenSearch queryables:

  * If the column in the database has no prefix, use none in the template too (e.g. ``startTime``).
  * If the column has a prefix, it gets transformed, so for example, ``eoInstrument`` in the database becomes ``eo:instrument`` in the template.
  * The "eo" prefix has a special rule, when it's used in the ``products`` table, it's called ``eop`` in the template. For example the column ``eoSensorMode`` in the ``products`` tables becomes ``eop:sensorMode``.
* Two special CQL functions assist in the creation of links:

  * ``serviceLink`` takes a URL template using the `Java Formatter syntax <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html>`_ and all the subsequent parameters are meant to be replaced in the template, one by one. This is used for links that are built on the fly based on product/collection attributes only.
  * ``templateLink`` takes a URL template using a single ``${BASE_URL}`` placeholder, and replaces it with the base URL of the request. This is already used by RSS output, and assumes the links are contained database fields, like the OGC links.
