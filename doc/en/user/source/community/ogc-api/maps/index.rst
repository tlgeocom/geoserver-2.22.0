OGC API - Maps
==============

A `OGC API - Maps <https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-maps>`_ based on the current early specification draft, delivering partial functionality:

- Collection listing
- Styles per collection
- Map and info support for single collection

Missing functionality at the time of writing, and known issues:

- API definition
- Maps specific metadata (e.g., scale ranges)
- Support for multi-collection map representation
- HTML representation of a map with OpenLayers is only partially functional
