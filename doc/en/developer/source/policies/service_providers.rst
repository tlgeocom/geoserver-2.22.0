Service Providers
=================

Service providers are an important part of GeoServer community, thank you for helping GeoServer reach a larger audience. Just as open source is a part of your success, your participation and investment is fundamental to the GeoServer project's sustainability.

The PSC manages:

* :website:`GeoServer Commercial Support <support>` (geoserver.org)
* `Service Providers List <https://www.osgeo.org/service-providers/?p=geoserver>`__ (osgeo.org)
  
  Available from `project page <https://www.osgeo.org/projects/geoserver/>`__ from *view all service providers* link.

In addition:

* Project :wiki:`sponsorship <Sponsor>` is another way to increase visibility, with specific activities available to sponsor throughout the year. Financial support is also recognized on the `osgeo sponsor <https://www.osgeo.org/sponsors/>`__ page.

Service Provider checklist
--------------------------

To recognizing experienced providers and core contributors consistently we have developed the following checklist.

Core contributors: take responsibility for the project, meeting all three core responsibilities:

* ``core`` demonstrating an ongoing responsibility: security email list, releases, supported extension
* ``committer`` active development: geoserver-devel, review of pull-requests, assigned jira tickets, development activities such bug-stomps and sprint participation
* ``support`` sustained community support: geoserver-user, review of jira, gis.stackexchange.com, something!

Experienced providers: work on GeoServer when hired by customers but are not always active, demonstrating experience with a selection of the following checklist labels:

* ``development`` feature development: examples GISP proposal, community module
* ``coding`` work on java code, bug fix, signed code contribution agreement
* ``documentation`` contributions to user guide or similar
* ``translation`` helped out translation of application or user guide
* ``outreach`` public presentations of geoserver at foss4g and regional events, public writing such as blog posts, podcast etc...
* ``training`` link to your geoserver training page
* ``services`` link to your geoserver consulting or services page
* ``product`` link to a geoserver based product

Service provider:

* Ask to be listed
* Provide a text description and icon.
  
  Please write description of services offered in third-person (as this text is part of the GeoServer website describing you)
