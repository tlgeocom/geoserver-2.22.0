.. note:: Voting on GeoServer Improvement Proposal (GSIP)
   
   #. Proposals may be made by any interested party (PSC, Non-PSC, committer,user,etc...).
   
      All community members are encouraged to review proposals, and provide their support and feedback.
   
   #. Each PSC member may vote one of the following in support of the proposal:
   
      * +1 : For
      * +0: Mildly for, but mostly indifferent
      * -0: Mildly against, but mostly indifferent
      * -1 : Against, accompanied with a detailed reason of being against
   
   #. Voting remains open for ten days or until all PSC members have cast their vote.
   
      * At the end of ten days time any remaining votes are assumed to be +0.
      
      * Any active PSC member can during ten days request an extension of voting for
        an additional ten days; the voting period can only be extended once.

      * Any PSC member who votes "-1" against a proposal must provide a
        reasonable explanation as to why.
        
      * Any PSC member who votes "-1" against a proposal has a limited time to
        provide constructive feedback as to how their -1 vote can be addressed.
        
        The GSIP author must incorporate any reasonable feedback into the proposal.

        The PSC member who voted "-1" must consider whether their feedback has been
        addressed and whether they wish to change their vote.
           
   #. Voting results:
      
      * A vote of "+1" means support for a proposal
      * The neutral votes "+0", "0", and "-0" all count the same as "0" but permit PSC members
        to indicate a slight tendency for, neutral, or against a proposal respectively
      * A vote of "-1" means opposition to the proposal

      A unanimous response is:
      
      * Successful: No -1 votes against it, or
      * Unsuccessful: No +1 votes for it.
   
   #. A GSIP is accepted if it receives:

      * at least 30% "+1" votes, and
      * no "-1" votes (or all feedback from any "-1" votes has been addressed and any "-1" voters have changed their votes)
   
   #. In the event of an *successful non unanimous* vote, the following steps are taken:
 
      * Each member who votes -1 *may* supply an alternative with which the original author can use to rework the proposal in order to satisfy that PSC member.
      * If at least one -1 voting PSC member supplies some alternative criteria, the original author must rework the proposal and resubmit, and the voting process starts again from scratch.
      * If no -1 voters are able to supply alternative criteria, the proposal is accepted.
   
   #. In the event of an *unsuccessful* vote, the author may choose to rework and submit.
      
      A proposal may not be resubmitted after being rejected three times.
